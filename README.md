# SDS Ansible code

Notes: 
Used for the initial sds platform hosts configuration depending on hosting.   
Works only with Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS or equivalent.   

Usage:   
1. Check and update inventory with required variables.   
2. Trigger the ansible configuration from ./bootstrap.sh script in the sds-platform-bootstrap repository   
OR from here with "./run-ansible.sh sds controllers".   
3. If this was ran manually, return to sds-platform-bootstrap script and perform the next steps.
